For the specific scripting/programming language for the trade website you can choose. We have everything as one file for simplicity.
So for example if you like PHP use the index.php, if you like the go use the main.go etc.
(Names may change but you get the idea)
Perfect time to snag Kubeo.trade while you're at it lol.
